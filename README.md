# testrepo

# This is a comment on my "testrepo" Repository, however it may come up as a sub-heading instead

Welcome travellers... 

This markdown file you are currently reading, within this humble GitHub Repository, is one part of my journey to conquer the beast of Git and GitHub. 

This Repository will serve to expand upon my knowledge; enabling me to publish my projects outside of my domain!
